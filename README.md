My portfolio 
This project is about me, my projects,
my contact information, or who wants to get in touch with me,
and my social media. 
I give you a brief description of what I like, what I'm working on, among other things. 
This application is more for you to get to know me and learn more about me.

It has few functions. I hope you like it. Thank you for visiting my project.
